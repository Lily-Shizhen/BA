The code are organized based on Figures, each folder will have some similar files,like"Preprocess, generating_pickle,visualizations", with only some parameters differences.
The steps to replicate the results follows the steps below:

Step 1:RUN "EarlyAscent_Preprocess" to get the "result" file

Step 2: RUN "generating_pickles" to get the "results_pickle" file

Step 3: RUN corresponding visualization files

| **Task (\( x, y \))**  | A pair of input vector \( x \) and corresponding output \( y \). Input \( x \) is sampled from a Gaussian, and \( y \) is generated using a linear transformation of \( x \). | Generated via `SampleGenerator` methods like `generate_xy_samples`. | Input \( x \) is a multivariate Gaussian vector, and \( y = x^T w + \text{noise}` with \( w \) as the task's weight. |
| **Component (Topic)**  | A Gaussian component in the mixture model. Represents a group of similar tasks. Each component has mean ($\mu_m $) and weight vector ($w_m$). | Represented in `self.topic_ms` (means) and `self.topic_ws` (weights). | Each component is defined by its mean vector $\mu_m $ and weight vector $w_m $, which are used to generate tasks. |
